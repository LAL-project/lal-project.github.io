# LAL project

In this page you will find information about the Linear Arrangement Library (LAL) project on github: from source code and free software to documentation and tests.

Visit the official webpage of the project [here](https://cqllab.upc.edu/lal). There you will find information about the authors, data that you can use to try LAL, user guides, information about courses and much more.

## Source code and Free Software

LAL is [free software](https://www.fsf.org/): its [source code](https://github.com/LAL-project/linear-arrangement-library) is distributed under the Affero GPL v3 along with every official release.

## Tests

If you want to build LAL on your machine from sources, or make changes, you are encouraged to [run tests](https://github.com/LAL-project/tests) to ensure everything works correctly. Tests are also distributed under the Affero GPL v3.

## The treebank parser

We have strived to ease the process of working with LAL with the [treebank parser](https://github.com/LAL-project/treebank-parser) tool, which can parse a treebanks in various formats and convert them to a format that LAL understands. This tool is also distributed under the Affero GPL v3.

## Python wrapper

LAL is a C++ library, but it can also be used from [python](https://github.com/LAL-project/python-interface) thanks to [SWIG](https://swig.org/).

## Other repositories

- Code for profiling purposes. If you want to improve LAL in any way, feel free to peruse the [profiling](https://github.com/LAL-project/profiling) project to measure execution times.

## Online documentation

Documentation is available online in [doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/index.html) format for every official release of LAL.
